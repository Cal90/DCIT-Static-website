      <h1 class="area">MY LIFESTYLE</h1>
      <p1 class="lyt">
    Do you ever wonder why people live their life and it is different from other people? There are many 
    reasons to that. We call this a lifestyle. From one time to other times, people do what pleases them. 
    People forge lifestyles. This simply means that they act accordingly to relate to a certain group of people's 
    way of living. For me, I will say there is the need for personality check. This makes people sober and live
    within their means. Hence, their lifestyle. In this article, I want to talk about myself, my way of life,
    hence my lifestyle. For instance every two months, I visit my village. I have this mentality that connecting 
    with people especially our loved ones, brings some sense of belonging and full happiness. At least for eight 
    times in the period I spend in the village, I take my young siblings to party since for far too long they 
    have got this kind of opportunity. Living in the city brings so much experience to this kind of enjoyment.
    It is very easy to say people in the village have boring experience in relation to partying and enjoyment.
    In my upcoming articles, I will talk about the village life experience.</p>

        <h2 class="area" >THE SHS I ATTENDED</h2> 
        <p2 class="lyt">
     Most of you have always talked and debated and even gone to the extent of fighting on which school is the 
     best. The best school in Ghana is PRESEC. There is no doubt about this. I always imagine the way people 
     do their things in their various schools. Being in that school, I can't say that was the best years in my ife
     but I can say they were my most educational years. My first day in this school was so terrifying yet I was excited. 
     It felt much to me as being an adult. Before that day, I have heard rumours about bullying,seduction and 
     peer pressure in the highest order. I saw these many people around and I said to myself that will all these 
     become my friends? How was I ever going to make my way around? Suddenly the air changed. That day went really fast.
     Looking forward to seeing my first lesson, I was ready to meet up with my new teachers and so ready to ask silly questions.
     During all these times, I faced my demons and I was inspired as well. I've learned so much about myself and so much 
     about life. I learnt what the words family, love, law and betrayal meant. Even with these, I never changed
     my personality. </p2>

    <h3 class="area" >MY LIFE EXPERIENCE AND DREAM</h3>
    <P3 class="lyt" >
   Everyone has a dream to become something in their life and we work hard to follow our dreams. It is very good
   to have dreams because they help us to choose the correct path and make uss successful. It never allows us to waste 
   our time and perform the best. When i was young, I use to watch different videos of pilots and aeroplanes. 
   When I was in primary school, I performed many annual function research and I had good understanding on it.
   I was very young and till today, I could remember when people cheered me up for my intense knowledge about 
   the parts of the plane and every little thing that happen on air. My parents admitted that I would be a great 
   pilot. I learn daily and focus on what my teacher says at school. If we decide to be the best human being, It 
   will all be upon our hard work and passion. We should learn everyday and everything but focus on one thing.
   Always be true to yourself, be the best in your profession and this is the key to success.</P3
